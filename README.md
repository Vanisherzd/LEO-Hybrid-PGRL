## 🌌 Abstract: The Evolution of Autonomous Orbit Prediction

Predicting satellite trajectories in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is a fundamental challenge for space operations. This project documents a scientific evolution in orbital modeling:

1. **Classical Physics**: Started with SGP4, limited by analytical simplifications (km-level error).
2. **Pure Neural ODEs**: Attempted to model state dynamics via Differentiable RK4 Solvers on RTX 5080. Discovered **Lyapunov Instability**—pure neural integration diverges catastrophically over 100-minute windows.
3. **Hybrid PGRL (SOTA)**: Pivoted to **Physics-Guided Residual Learning**. By using SGP4 as a stable global anchor and training a deep MLP to correct only the residual error, we achieved stable, sub-200m precision across different satellite missions.

This repository provides an end-to-end suite for AI-defined satellite operations, from high-fidelity physics truth generation to real-time ground station scheduling.

## 🔬 Scientific Benchmark Table

Head-to-head comparison over a continuous 100-minute integration window (Formosat-5/7 characteristics).

| Model Architecture            | RMSE (100 min) | Performance Characteristic                        |
| :---------------------------- | :------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **SGP4 (Baseline)**           | ~1.50 km       | Stable but limited by analytical drag/J2 models   |
| **Pure LSTM/GRU**             | > 270 km       | **Divergent.** Catastrophic temporal drift.       |
| **Pure Neural ODE (MLP)**     | ~0.10 km       | **Local Precision.** High accuracy, low stability |
| **Hybrid PGRL (Transferred)** | **157 meters** | **Optimal.** Globally stable & mission-agnostic.  |

**Key Finding**: The **Hybrid PGRL** strategy (modeling $\Delta r$ instead of $r$) effectively "domesticates" neural divergence, allowing high-precision AI to serve operational mission requirements.
